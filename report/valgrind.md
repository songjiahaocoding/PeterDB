### 2. Using a Debugger
- I use CLion debugger most of the time. As I defined some classes, I will check tha variables during
debugging to make sure everything is on track.
- Another very important feature about Clion debugger is that I can jump to the memory of the variables
to see what's in the memory to see what's really going on. 


### 3. Using Valgrind
- Describe how you use Valgrind to detect memory leaks and other problems in your code and show screenshot of the Valgrind report.
